        <h1>JAH'S BIO</h1>
        <div class="main">
            <div id="main-text">
            Jah's origins are still unclear. One can only fathom Jah's inception. However, what we do know is about his dubs.
            These dubs are of the highest quality dubs only for the people with the golden ear.
            Those who possess this golden ear are blessed with the ability to interpret the dubs.
            Dubs both digital and physical are possessed.
            However following the culture of dub plates, physical ones must be kept forever as shown in the photo.
            A mix of engineering and music to create these physical formats.
